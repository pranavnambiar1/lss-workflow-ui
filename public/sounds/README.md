# Sound Effects

This directory contains sound effects used in the LSS Workflow UI:

- `click.mp3`: Used when selecting tasks
- `drop.mp3`: Used when dropping API nodes
- `connect.mp3`: Used when connecting nodes

These sound files should be replaced with actual sound effects before production deployment.
